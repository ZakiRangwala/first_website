				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>My name is Zaki and I am 14 years old. My hobbies are playing sports, participating in extra-curriculur activities and reading. I am not that good in programming but have experience in programs like Java other than html. This year is my first year of programming which is a oretty good start giving that I am soon participating in THACKS 2. I chose surgery as my topic
				because it is something that inspires me. In the near future(hopefully), I would love to become a surgeon and help people by performung surgeries. </p>
