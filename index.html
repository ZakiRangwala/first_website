		<h2 id="SCRUBS">What Is Surgery?</h2>
		  <!--A breif description on Surgery-->
			<p>Surgery is an ancient method that is performed on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological or therapeutic condition such as a disease or injury.
			It is meant to help improve function in your body or your appearance or to repair unwanted elements of your body.
			<q>Surgical procedure<q><q>,<q><q>operation<q><q> or simply <q><q>surgery<q><q> are terms used when performing a surgery. So in this context, <q><q>operate<q><q> means to perform or undergo surgery. 
			And so the word <q><q>surgical<q><q> is applied to surgical instruments or nurses.  The patient who is undergoing the surgery can be a person or even an animal.
		<h3>Surgical Team</h3>
			A person who practices surgery is called a <q><q>Surgeon<q><q> and the person practicing surgical assistance is the surgeon's assistant.
			A surgical team is made up of a surgeon, surgeon's assistant, anesthesia provider, circulating nurse and surgical technologist. 
			Surgery can usually last for minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. <q><q>Surgery<q><q> is also a term that can be indicated to a place where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.

			<li>Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity.</li>
			<li>Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis.</li>

			<li>Amputation involves cutting off a body part</li>
			<li>Laser surgery involves use of a laser for cutting tissue instead of a scalpel or similar surgical instruments. </li>
