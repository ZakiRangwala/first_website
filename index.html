		<h2 id="SCRUBS">What Is Surgery?</h2>
		  <!--A breif description on Surgery-->
			<p>Surgery is an ancient method that is performed on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological or therapeutic condition such as a disease or injury.
			It is meant to help improve function in your body or your appearance or to repair unwanted elements of your body.
			Surgical procedure,operation or simply surgery are terms used when performing a surgery. So in this context,operate means to perform or undergo surgery. 
			And so the word surgical is applied to surgical instruments or nurses. The patient who is undergoing the surgery can be a person or even an animal.</p>
		<h3>Surgical Team</h3>
			<p>A person who practices surgery is called a Surgeon and the person practicing surgical assistance is the surgeon's assistant.
			A surgical team is made up of a surgeon, surgeon's assistant, anesthesia provider, circulating nurse and surgical technologist. 
			Surgery can usually last for minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. Surgery is also a term that can be indicated to a place where surgery is performed, or simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.

		<h2 id="SPECIAL">Types of Surgery</h2>
			<p>Surgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request.</li>
			<li>Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity.</li>
			<li>Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis.</li>
			<li>Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.</li>
			<li>Cosmetic surgery is done to improve the appearance</li>
			<li>Amputation involves cutting off a body part</li>
			<li>Laser surgery involves use of a laser for cutting tissue instead of a scalpel or similar surgical instruments. </li>
			<li>Microsurgery involves the use of an operating microscope for the surgeon to see small structures. </li>
			<li>Robotic surgery makes use of a surgical robot, such as the Da Vinci or the Zeus surgical systems, to control the instrumentation under the direction of the surgeon.</li>

		<h2 id="DEF">Terminology</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Excision surgery names often start with a name for the organ to be excised (cut out) and end in -ectomy.</li>
			<li>Procedures involving cutting into an organ or tissue end in -otomy. A surgical procedure cutting through the abdominal wall to gain access to the abdominal cavity is a laparotomy.</li>
			<li>Minimally invasive procedures involving small incisions through which an endoscope is inserted end in -oscopy. For example, such surgery in the abdominal cavity is called laparoscopy.</li>
			<li>Procedures for formation of a permanent or semi-permanent opening called a stoma in the body end in -ostomy.</li>
			<li>Reconstruction, plastic or cosmetic surgery of a body part starts with a name for the body part to be reconstructed and ends in -oplasty. Rhino is used as a prefix for "nose", therefore a rhinoplasty is reconstructive or cosmetic surgery for the nose.</li>
			<li>Repair of damaged or congenital abnormal structure ends in -rraphy.</li>
			<li>Reoperation (return to the operating room) refers to a return to the operating theater after an initial surgery is performed to re-address an aspect of patient care best treated surgically. Reasons for reoperation include persistent bleeding after surgery, development of or persistence of infection or, more insidiously, retained foreign objects.</li>
